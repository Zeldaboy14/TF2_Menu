# TF2_Menu + Sounds and Music
 Old Menu + Ahud configurations that i use.
 Includes Splatoon SFX's curtosy of Optimus, and new game start music from stuff i pulled from Youtube. Some stuff is meme,
 some is original game music to other games, and some is custom music dev'd by others (credit to those who made some of those.)
 Should note that under normal circumstances, Ahud and old menu are not compatible. I made them compatible years ago, and
 old menu is more updated in this then the game bannana version.
